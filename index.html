    <p>My name is Jose Narnjo and I am 23 years old. My goal for this
        class is to learn and be fluent in Html and Css. I had signed up for 
        a bootcamp for front end development because I needed a career change 
        and i was always intrested in the tech industry. I also want to be 
        fluent in JavaScript because you need to know both languages to be a succesful front end developer.
        I would also love to work online and remotely.

    </p>
